# Udacity Unit Testing Tutorial

Welcome to the Udacity Unit Testing tutorial repository! This repository contains several JavaScript files designed to help you learn the basics of unit testing with Jest.

## Files Overview

fib.js: A non-recursive Fibonacci function.

fib2.js: A recursive Fibonacci function.

fib.test.js: A Jest test suite for testing fib.js.

userDataMock.js: A mock function that simulates calling an API to fetch user data.

userData.test.js: A Jest test suite that demonstrates how to mock the fetchUserData function in userDataMock.js.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

## Install Dependencies

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

`npm install`

## Running Tests

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the tests with Jest by executing the following command:

`npm run test`

This will run all the test suites (fib.test.js and userData.test.js) and display the results in the terminal.

## Explanation

fib.js and fib2.js contain different implementations of the Fibonacci sequence.

fib.test.js tests the non-recursive fib.js function to ensure its correctness.

userDataMock.js simulates an API call, and userData.test.js shows how to mock the fetchUserData function using Jest.
